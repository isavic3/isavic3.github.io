excerpt: "About Me..."
---
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester. I am majoring in psychology with a minor in statistics. Most of my research, however, is within the department of Brain and Cognitive science. Right now, I am involved in two research projects: language processing and the neuro level of decision making. The former is interested in the working mechanisms that allow listeners to adapt to a deviated speech. The latter one investigates the rate of neuro-firing in monkeys when involved in the visual task. Both of these projects, even though seemingly different, share the foundational principle: they both investigate the importance of forming prediction for decision making.
